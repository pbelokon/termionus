We are will eventually create a logo but for now you can look at this >\_

## What is `termionus`?

`termionus` is an open source terminal emulator for all operating systems.
The main focus of `termionus` is to provide great user experience for developers, as well as provide a good support for several types of programs and available shells.

## Project status

termionus is in a very beginning of the development. This stage can also be described as preparation of the the ground before planting a seed üå±.

## How this project started

This project came out spontaneously. Initially me([Pavel Belokon](https://github.com/pbelokon)) and my best friend [Gerardo Enrique Arriaga Rendon](https://github.com/JerryHue), planed to work on a Plain Text editor but we never could start! "Usually what happens to a lot of projectsüòê". One day after my friend got tired of using
horrible terminal emulators he sought why not create my own. He brought this idea to me and it sounded more interesting the a text editor, so we scraped all other unstarted projects we had, and started serous on this one. A quote that describes everything "If you don't like something make your own"!

## Who built it?

`termionus` started development in the beginning of spring, 2022, by two programmers: [Gerardo Enrique Arriaga Rendon](https://github.com/JerryHue) and [Pavel Belokon](https://github.com/pbelokon).
