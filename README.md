# `termionus`

We will eventually create a logo but for now you can look at this `>\_`.

## What is `termionus`?

`termionus` is an open source terminal emulator for Windows and Linux operating systems.
The main focus of `termionus` is to provide great user experience for developers, as well as provide a good support for several types of programs and available shells.

## Project status

`termionus` is in the very beginning of development. This stage can also be considered as the preparation of the soil before planting the seed üå±.

## How this project started

This project came out spontaneously. Initially me ([Pavel Belokon](https://github.com/pbelokon)) and my best friend, [Gerardo Enrique Arriaga Rendon](https://github.com/JerryHue), planned to work on a plain text editor, yet we never started it! As it usually happens with a lot of projects üòê. One day after my friend got tired of using
and trying terminal emulators that did not meet his needs, he thought, "why not create my own?" He mentioned his idea to me, and it sounded more interesting than a text editor, so we scrapped all the other projects we had planned, and started for real on this one. A quote that describes this project very well:

     If you don't like something make it yourself!
